// FinCom's service worker (stability batch 4): the app's own files kept on this computer, so a second open is instant
// and FinCom opens without a line. Built by vite.config.js (fincom-sw) with this build's id and file list.
// Rules (the owner's, 11-Oct-2026):
//  - never an outdated app after a release: the page itself (index.html) always comes from the network first (past
//    every cache, with a short wait), and only from here when there is no line; every other file has its build's hash
//    in its name or address, so a new build's files are new files. A new build's worker takes over once a page of its
//    build has drawn FinCom (27-Oct-2026: never while a page is loading; install below) and drops the old build's files; the open page says "A newer FinCom is out. Reload" (fresh.js);
//  - only FinCom's own code, styles and fonts are kept: nothing from Supabase (the firm's data), the bridge, Sentry or
//    any other address goes through here at all; build.json is always the network's;
//  - on sign-out the page clears the files kept after the first open (fincom-files:…) as well (src/js/27).
const VERSION = "mw7hdxa7-0acc15";
// round 73 B: FILES, kept at install, are what the first page needs; REST, the other files of this build, are kept once
// the first page is up and the computer is idle (the page sends "fincom:keep-rest", main.jsx)
